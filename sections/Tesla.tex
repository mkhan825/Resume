\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemindent}{-6mm}
  \vspace{-0.2cm}\item Completed working voltage sensor and SPI drivers despite a complicated bug in Tesla’s SPI silicon
  \vspace{-0.2cm}\item Implemented and rigorously tested a software architecture designed to funnel temperature and voltage data over SPI
  \vspace{-0.2cm}\item Improved a python script to recursively parse generated protobuf, automated sending protobuf messages by filling a .JSON/.proto file, and synced this script as well as the hardware based on messages received over UART
  \vspace{-0.2cm}\item Created a python script able to generate QSPI images working around the LittleFS library, which used linux-like commands
  \vspace{-0.2cm}\item Gained experience writing firmware running ARM CMSIS RTOS wrapper for FreeRTOS, including drivers, interrupt handlers, etc
\end{itemize}
